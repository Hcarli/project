    <h1>The Solow Growth Model</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Solow Growth Model, developed by Robert Solow in 1956, is a classical model of economic growth
            that emphasizes the role of capital accumulation, labor, and technological progress.
            It is used to explain long-term economic growth by looking at productivity, capital accumulation,
            population growth, and technological innovation.</p>

        <h2>Assumptions of the Solow Model</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The production function has constant returns to scale.</li>
            <li>Output is a function of capital and labor, typically represented by a Cobb-Douglas production function.</li>
            <li>Technological progress is exogenous.</li>
            <li>The savings rate, population growth rate, and depreciation rate are constant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Parameters in the Solow Model</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>\( s \) - Savings Rate</strong><br>
            <em>Definition:</em> The proportion of total output (GDP) that is saved and invested in capital.<br>
            <em>Role in the Model:</em> Determines how much of the output is used for capital accumulation. Higher savings rates lead to higher levels of capital accumulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>\( \delta \) - Depreciation Rate</strong><br>
            <em>Definition:</em> The rate at which capital depreciates or wears out over time.<br>
            <em>Role in the Model:</em> Reduces the effective capital stock each period. Higher depreciation rates mean that more capital is lost each period, reducing the steady-state level of capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>\( n \) - Population Growth Rate</strong><br>
            <em>Definition:</em> The rate at which the population (or labor force) grows over time.<br>
            <em>Role in the Model:</em> Affects the capital-to-labor ratio. Higher population growth rates require more capital to maintain the same capital-to-labor ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>\( g \) - Technological Progress Rate</strong><br>
            <em>Definition:</em> The rate at which technology improves, leading to higher productivity.<br>
            <em>Role in the Model:</em> Increases the effectiveness of labor, allowing the economy to produce more output with the same amount of capital and labor. This shifts the production function upwards over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>\( \alpha \) - Output Elasticity of Capital</strong><br>
            <em>Definition:</em> The share of output attributable to capital in the production function.<br>
            <em>Typical Value:</em> Empirical studies often use a value of around \( \alpha = \frac{1}{3} \) (or 0.33), which reflects the capital share of income in many economies.<br>
            <em>Role in the Model:</em> Determines the curvature of the production function. It reflects the importance of capital relative to labor in the production process.
        </p>
        <h2>Production Function in the Solow Model</h2>
        <p>The production function typically used in the Solow model is a Cobb-Douglas production function of the form:</p>
        <p>\[ Y = K^\alpha (AL)^{1 - \alpha} \]</p>
        <p>
            Where:
            <ul>
                <li>\( Y \) is the total output.</li>
                <li>\( K \) is the capital stock.</li>
                <li>\( A \) is the level of technology.</li>
                <li>\( L \) is the labor force.</li>
                <li>\( \alpha \) is the output elasticity of capital.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steady-State Calculations</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Steady-State Capital per Worker (\( k^* \)):</strong><br>
            The steady-state level of capital per worker is where the economy's capital stock remains constant over time.<br>
            <em>Formula:</em><br>
            \[ k^* = \left( \frac{s}{\delta + n + g} \right)^{\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}} \]
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steady-State Output per Worker (\( y^* \)):</strong><br>
            The steady-state level of output per worker is derived from the steady-state capital per worker.<br>
            <em>Formula:</em><br>
            \[ y^* = (k^*)^\alpha \]

        <h2>Implications of the Solow Model</h2>
        <p>The Solow model suggests that economies with higher savings rates will have higher
            levels of capital and output per worker in the steady state.
            However, it also implies that without technological progress, long-term growth in
            per capita output cannot be sustained.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Economic Growth of Countries Using the Solow Model</h2>
        <p>The Solow model can be used to compare the economic growth of different countries
            by analyzing their key economic indicators such as savings rates, population growth,
            and technological progress. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Step 1: Gather Data</h5>
        <p>Collect data on GDP, capital stock, labor force, savings rate, depreciation rate,
            population growth rate, and technological progress for each country.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Step 2: Calculate Key Variables</h5>
        <p>Compute output per worker (\( y \)) and capital per worker (\( k \)) for each country.
            Determine the steady-state levels of these variables using the formulas:</p>
        <p>\[k^* = \left( \frac{sA}{\delta + n} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}\]</p>
        <p>\[y^* = A (k^*)^\alpha\]</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Step 3: Analyze Steady-State Predictions</h5>
        <p>Compare the steady-state predictions of output per worker and capital per worker
            across countries. This comparison helps in understanding the potential long-term economic
            positions of the countries.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Step 4: Evaluate Convergence</h5>
        <p>Examine whether poorer countries are growing faster than richer ones, as predicted
            by the conditional convergence hypothesis.</p>
        <p></p>
