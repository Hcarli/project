            <h2>Welcome to Our Comprehensive Analysis of Economic Growth</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our comprehensive analysis of economic growth, where we delve into the intricacies
                of how nations develop and prosper over time. Our study leverages data from the Penn World Table,
                a rich dataset that provides a wealth of economic variables for countries around the globe.
                By employing the Solow Growth Model, we provide insights into the steady-state economies of various
                nations, shedding light on the factors driving growth and stability.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Economic Growth</h2>
            <p>Economic growth is a critical indicator of a country's overall health and prosperity.
                It represents the increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy over time.
                By examining economic growth, we can identify trends, predict future performance, and implement
                policies to foster sustainable development.</p>

            <h2>The Solow Growth Model</h2>
            <p>To model the economic growth data, we utilize the Solow Growth Model, a fundamental framework in economics.
                This model helps explain long-term economic growth by considering four key factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population Growth</strong>: The rate at which the labor force increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Savings rates</strong>: The portion of income that is saved and invested in capital.</li>
                <li><strong>Depreciation</strong>: The rate at which capital wears out or becomes obsolete.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Progress</strong>: Innovations and improvements in technology that enhance productivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Solow Model posits that an economy will eventually reach a steady state where the capital stock,
                output, and consumption grow at constant rates. By analyzing data through this lens, we can determine the
                steady state for each country and understand the underlying dynamics of their economic growth.</p>

            <h2>Data from the Penn World Table</h2>
            <p>Our analysis is grounded in the extensive data provided by the Penn World Table. This
                dataset includes various economic indicators such as GDP, capital stock, labor force, and
                technological progress for numerous countries over several decades. By utilizing this data,
                we can accurately model and compare the steady-state economies of different nations.</p>

            <h2>Steady State Analysis</h2>
            <p>For each country in our study, we calculate the steady-state levels of capital and output. This involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Determining the savings rate</strong>: The portion of output invested in new capital.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculating the effective depreciation rate</strong>: Combining physical capital depreciation with the population growth rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessing technological progress</strong>: Evaluating how advancements in technology influence productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Population Growth</strong>: The rate at which the labor force increases.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By integrating these variables, we can depict the steady-state equilibrium
                for each country, offering a clear picture of their long-term economic potential.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>Our analysis reveals significant variations in the steady-state economies of
                different countries. Factors such as savings rates, population growth rates, investment in capital,
                and technological innovation play crucial roles in determining economic outcomes.
                By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and researchers can better grasp the complexities of
                economic growth and devise strategies to enhance it.</p>
            <p>Through an analysis and the application of the Solow Growth Model to data from the
                Penn World Table, we provide valuable insights into the steady-state economies of various nations.
                This understanding is pivotal for fostering sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of life for people around the world.</p>
            <p>Explore our detailed findings and interactive visualizations to learn more about the economic growth
                patterns and steady states of countries across the globe.</p>
            <p>For implement this we use variables we get in penn world table at <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en"> Pennn World Table</a>,
                download the data in csv file, and after do some analysis about which variables will be used, we transform this csv
                in a database called growth.db to store the data that will be use.
            <p> We use <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">OpenAi</a> to best understand how to use this excelent tool, improving and learning about
                how to create some html pages and graphics, and use pandas library from python. We also use to acelerate the creation of the content
                of this page in many ways, but always conscious that it's just a tool to work better and learn more about many topics.</p>
            <p> We treated this data, using pandas library and after it we used to mesure the growth of an nation adopting the Sollow Model</p>
            <p> I hope this have utility from people that like economic topics.</p>
