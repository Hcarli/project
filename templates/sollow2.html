    <h1>The Solow Growth Model</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Comparing Economic Growth of Countries Using the Solow Model</h2>
        <p>The Solow model can be used to compare the economic growth of different countries by analyzing their key economic indicators such as savings rates, population growth, and technological progress. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Gather Data</h3>
        <p>Collect data on GDP, capital stock, labor force, savings rate, depreciation rate, population growth rate, and technological progress for each country.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Calculate Key Variables</h3>
        <p>Compute output per worker (\( y \)) and capital per worker (\( k \)) for each country. Determine the steady-state levels of these variables using the formulas:</p>
        <p>\[
            k^* = \left( \frac{sA}{\delta + n} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}
        \]</p>
        <p>\[
            y^* = A (k^*)^\alpha
        \]</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Analyze Steady-State Predictions</h3>
        <p>Compare the steady-state predictions of output per worker and capital per worker across countries. This comparison helps in understanding the potential long-term economic positions of the countries.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Evaluate Convergence</h3>
        <p>Examine whether poorer countries are growing faster than richer ones, as predicted by the conditional convergence hypothesis.</p>
        <h3>Step 5: Perform Empirical Analysis</h3>
        <p>Conduct regression analysis with GDP growth rates and other key indicators to empirically test the predictions of the Solow model.</p>
        <p>This approach helps in understanding the underlying factors driving economic growth and provides a framework for comparing the growth trajectories of different countries.</p>
