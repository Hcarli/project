<h2> What is Economic Growth? </h2>


         <p><strong>Economic growth:</strong> Economic growth is an increase in the production of economic goods and services in one period of time compared with a previous period.
          It can be measured in nominal or real (adjusted to remove inflation) terms. Traditionally,
          aggregate economic growth is measured in terms of gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP),
          although alternative metrics are sometimes used.</p>

  <h2>Understanding Economic Growth</h2>

  <p>In simplest terms, economic growth refers to an increase in aggregate production in an economy,
    which is generally manifested in a rise in national income.</p>

    <p>Often, but not necessarily, aggregate gains in production correlate with increased average
    marginal productivity. That leads to an increase in incomes, inspiring consumers to open up their
    wallets and buy more, which means a higher material quality of life and standard of living.</p>

    <p>In economics, growth is commonly modeled as a function of physical capital, human capital,
    labor force, and technology. Simply put, increasing the quantity or quality of the working
    age population, the tools that they have to work with, and the recipes that they have available
    to combine labor, capital, and raw materials, will lead to increased economic output.</p>

  <h2>Phases of Economic Growth</h2>
  <p>The economy moves through different periods of activity. This movement is called the “business cycle.”
    It consists of four phases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Expansion</b> – During this phase employment, income, industrial production, and sales all increase,
      nd there is a rising real GDP.</li>
      <li><b>Peak</b> – This is when an economic expansion hits its ceiling. It is in effect a turning point.</li>
      <li><b>Contraction</b> – During this phase the elements of an expansion all begin to decrease.
      It becomes a recession when a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy.</li>
      <li><b>Trough</b> – This is when an economic contraction hits its nadir.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A single business cycle is dated from peak to peak or trough to trough. Such cycles generally
    are not regular in length, and there can be a period of contraction during an expansion and vice versa.</p>

    <p>Since World War II, the U.S. economy has experienced more expansions than contractions.
    Between 1945 and 2019, the average expansion lasted about 65 months, while the average contraction was only 11 months.</p>
    <p>However, the Great Recession, from December 2007 to June 2009, went on for 18 months.
    This was followed by the longest expansion on record, 128 months, lasting until 2020 and the advent of the
    COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h5>Fast Fact</h5>

<div class="card" style="font-style: italic;">
  Governments often try to stimulate economic growth by lowering interest rates,
  which makes money cheaper to borrow. However, that can only last for so long.
  Eventually, as happened in 2022, rates need to be hiked to combat price inflation and keep the economy from boiling over.

  <h2>How To Measure Economic Growth</h2>

  <p>The most common measure of economic growth is real GDP. This is the total value of all goods and services
    produced in an economy, with that value adjusted to remove the effects of inflation.
    There are three different methods for looking at real GDP.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Quarterly growth at an annual rate – This looks at the change in the GDP from quarter to quarter,
        which is then compounded into an annual rate. For example, if one quarter’s change is 0.3%, then the
        annual rate would be extrapolated to be 1.2%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four-quarter or year-over-year growth rate – This compares a single quarter’s GDP from two successive years as a percentage.
        It is often used by businesses to offset the effects of seasonal variations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annual average growth rate – This is the average of changes in each of the four quarters.
        For example, if in 2022 there were four-quarter rates of 2%, 3%, 1.5%, and 1%, the annual average
        growth rate for the year would be 7.5% ÷ 4 = 1.875%.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>TIP: GDP, the most popular way to measure economic growth, is calculated by adding up all of the money
    spent by consumers, businesses, and the government in a given period.
    The formula is: GDP = consumer spending + business investment + government spending + net exports.</p>

    <p>Measuring the value of a commodity is tricky. Some goods and services are considered to be worth more than others.
    For example, a smartphone is more valuable than a pair of socks.
    Growth has to be measured in the value of goods and services, not just the quantity.</p>

    <p>Another problem is that not all individuals place the same value on the same goods and services.
    A heater is more valuable to a resident of Alaska, while an air conditioner is more valuable to a resident of Florida.
    Some people value steak more than fish and vice versa.</p>

    <p>A common approximation is current market value. In the United States, this is measured in terms
    of U.S. dollars and added together to produce aggregate measures of output, including GDP.</p>


</section>


<h5>Important fact</h5>

<div class="card">
  <p>There are alternatives to GDP. For example, the World Bank uses gross national income per capita,
    which includes income sent back by citizens working overseas, to measure economic growth,
    classify countries for analytical purposes, and determine borrowing eligibility.</p>

  <h2>How To Generate Economic Growth</h2>

  <p>Economic growth is dependent on the following four contributory areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Increase in Physical Capital Goods:</b> The first is an increase in the amount of physical capital goods in the economy.
    Adding capital to the economy tends to increase productivity of labor. Newer, better, and more
    tools mean that workers can produce more output per time period. For a simple example, a fisherman
    with a net will catch more fish per hour than a fisherman with a rod. However two things are critical to this process.
    Someone in the economy must first engage in some form of saving in order to free up the resources to create the new capital.
     In addition, the new capital must be of the right type, in the right place, and activated at the right time for
     workers to actually use it productively.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Improvements in Technology:</b> A second method of producing economic growth is through technological improvements.
    An example of this is the invention of gasoline fuel. Prior to the discovery of its energy-generating power,
    the economic value of petroleum was relatively low. This changed when the use of gasoline proved a more
    productive method of transporting goods. Improved technology allows workers to produce more output with
    the same stock of capital goods by combining them in novel ways that are more productive.
    Like capital growth, the rate of technical growth is highly dependent on the rate of savings and investment,
    as they are necessary to engage in research and development. The four factors of production are land and
    natural resources, labor, capital equipment, and entrepreneurship.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Growth of the Labor Force:</b> Another way to generate economic growth is to grow the labor force.
    All else being equal, more workers generate more economic goods and services. During the 19th century,
    a portion of the robust U.S. economic growth was due to a high influx of cheap, productive immigrant labor.
    However, as with capital-driven growth, there are some key conditions to this process.
    Increasing the labor force necessarily increases the amount of output that must be consumed
    in order to provide for the basic subsistence of the new workers, so the new workers need to be
    at least productive enough to offset this and not be net consumers. Also, just like additions to
    capital, it is important for the right type of workers to flow to the right jobs in the right places
    in combination with the right types of complementary capital goods in order to realize their productive potential.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Increase Human Capital:</b> The last method is to increase human capital. This means laborers become more
    accomplished at their crafts, raising their productivity through skills training, trial and error, or simply more practice.
    Savings, investment, and specialization are the most consistent and easily controlled methods.
    Human capital in this context can also refer to social and institutional capital.
    Behavioral tendencies toward higher social trust and reciprocity, along with political or
    economic innovations such as improved protections for property rights, are types of human
    capital that can increase the productivity of the economy.
  </li>
</ul>
